# C--
C-- is a popular, fast and very powreful high-level language. Just joking.

## Goal
The only goal of this project is to deepen knowledge of stuff how the programming languages do what they do. And try to make one.

## Functionality

<details>
  <summary>Types</summary>

  Currently C-- supports only 2 types - `int`, `bool`
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Arithmetic operations</summary>

  ### Unary operators

  `-`, `+` for `int`

  `!` for `bool`

  ### Binary operators

  `-`, `+`, `*`, `/`, `!=`, `&&`, `||` for `int` and `bool`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Variables</summary>

  ### Declaring a variable

  In the current implementation declaring variables is python-like. No type, just name and value.
